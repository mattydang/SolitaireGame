# SolitaireGame
Sample Solitaire Game created using Java as back-end and Java Swing as front-end. Java was responsible for controlling all game movements and logic behind each user input. Java Swing used to design playing surface and recognize user inputs at individual sections.

Aim was to make a playable version of the card classic game.

## Technologies Used:

### Java

Java was used for the back-end due to my familiarity of the language and its ability to perform OOP. Needed to use OOP since game elements all connected with each other, and it was easier to use inheritance to program logic of game.

### Java Swing

Java Swing was used for the front-end due to its compability with Java and its ease of use. Java Swing marks my first experiences completing front-end programming, and provides a great introduction to other languages such as JavaScript and its frameworks such as React and Vue.js.
